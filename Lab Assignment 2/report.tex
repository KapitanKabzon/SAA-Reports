\section{Introduction}

The NTC thermistors display non-linear resistance characteristics with temperature. The resistance of an NTC will decrease at the temperature increases. This behaviour is related to it's constant value $B$. This phenomenon allows for use of an NTC thermistor as a temperature sensor. In the discussed experiments a Vishay NTCLE100E3 thermistor was used, with $B=3977^{\circ}K$.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Expected Output}
The output of thermistor is said to be non-linear, for the NTCLE100E3 it can be described with equation for expected intermediate temperatures, taken from the NTC's datasheet:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:datasheet}
  R_T(T)=R_{ref}\cdot e^{A+\frac{B}{T}+\frac{C}{T^2}+\frac{D}{T^3}}
\end{equation}
where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constant values which are dependent on the thermistor; $R_{ref}$ is the resistance at a reference temperature---for the thermistor used in the experiment (Brown, Black, and Orange bands) it is $10000\Omega$,and the constant values:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline 
    $R_{ref}$  &  $10000\Omega$  \\
    $A$  &  $-14.6337$  \\
    $B$\footnotemark  &  $4791.842$  \\
    $C$  &  $-115334$  \\
    $D$  &  $-3.730535\cdot10^6$  \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \footnotetext{Note that this value is different to the $\beta$ ``$B$'' value of a thermistor, constants from this table should only be used in combination with eqation~\ref{eq:datasheet}}
\end{center}
Since, the temperature $T$ in the equation~\ref{eq:datasheet} is in $^\circ K$ for measurements in $^\circ C$ conversion is required:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ctok}
T_K=T_C+273.15^\circ
\end{equation}
The Siemens Handout describes how the output can be linearised in a range by use of a prallel resistor. The equation for the value of such resistor is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:siemens}
R_p=R_{T_{ctr}}\cdot\frac{B-T_{ctr}}{B+2\cdot T_{ctr}}
\end{equation}
where $R_{T_{ctr}}$ and $T_{ctr}$ are thermistor's resistance and temperature at the center of the temperature range, and $B$ is the $B$ ($\beta$) value of the thermistor. From this equation an ideal straight line equation for the linear sensor model can be found by calculating Output for $I_{min}$ and $I_{max}$, then sensitivity $K$ is
$$K=\frac{O(I_{max})-O(I_{min})}{I_{max}-I_{min}}$$
and y-intercept is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:intercept}
  a=O(I_{min})-KI_{min}
\end{equation}
the following experiments all measurements are compared against the linear model
\begin{equation}
  O(I)=KI+a
\end{equation}

\end{figure}
The expected output $R_{AB}(T)$ for a linearised thermistor setup shown in Fig.\ref{fig:parallel} can be derived from a basic equation for resistor:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rab}
  R_{AB}(T)=\frac{R_p\cdot R_T(T)}{R_p+R_T(T)}
\end{equation}
\section{Experiments}
For this lab assignment, two experiments were conducted. The first was to determine the following characteristics of the non-linear response of the NTC:\@ the resistance-temperature R-T and temperature-resistance T-R, the maximum non-linearity $\hat N$ as \% of $f.s.d$ (full scale deflection), and the response of the system linearised by a parallel resistor. The second experiment was done to find the time constant $\tau$ of the measurement system. Raw data from all measurements are presented in the Appendix.

Both of these experiments followed the same basic steps, where the thermistor was placed in an environment with a temperature significantly different from the ambient room temperature -- in a cup filled with either boiling or iced water. The temperature of the environment was measured with a Fluke Thermocouple.
\subsection{R-T and T-R Characteristics}
To measure the R-T and T-R characteristics, the resistance of the thermistor was measured with an AMPROBE AM-510-EUR multimeter, and recorded over a temperature range of 90--45$^{\circ}C$. This was achieved by measuring the temperature of boiling water in a cup, which was cooled from$~100^{\circ}$ to$~45^{\circ}$. As the temperature and the resistance were constantly changing, it was decided to record the setup in video format, in order to collect the necessary data points accurately when some significant temperature, for example, has occurred. Having collected this data, the non-linearity of the system can be determined.

Next, a parallel resistor was placed in the system, and the same procedure as previous was followed. In order to establish the necessary value of the parallel resistor, $R_{T_{ctr}}$ was recorded at $T_{ctr}=72.5^{\circ}C$ (the midpoint of the temperature range in which the resistance was measured) and calculated using the equation \#REFERENCE\# from the NTC datasheet. Ideally, placing a parallel resistor in the system would help to linearise the change in resistance of the thermistor as a result of the change in temperature of the environment.
\subsection{Time Constant}
In order to determine the time constant, the thermistor was again subjected to change in environment temperature, however this time the it was placed in iced water. The iced water throughout this experiment remained at a temperature between$~2^{\circ}$ and$~3^{\circ}$, which was as close to the triple point of water as the conditions would allow. This time, a 2k$\Omega$\ resistor was placed in parallel with the thermistor, and, with the same multimeter, the voltage across the thermistor was measured. This process was recorded again by video, and this was done in order to know the time it took for the thermistor to go from it's resistance at ambient room temperature, to it's resistance at approximately $~0^{\circ}$.
\section{Results}
Here, the data from each part the experiments are analysed and discussed. Important graphs, equations, and tables are shown directly in these subsections. Complete calculated data will be put into tables, graphs that can be seen in the Appendix.
\subsection{R-T Characteristics}
\subsubsection{Non-Linear}
The equation for the ideal straight line for input range 45--90$^\circ$ was found using the equation from the datasheet
$$K=\frac{R_T(90)-R_T(45)}{90-45}=\frac{0.915443-4.37181}{90-45}=-0.07681$$aprox
$$a=R_T(45)-KI_{min}=4.37181+0.07681\cdot45=7.828$$
The R-T expected output with combined data from all non-linear measurement runs is shown in the following figure:

From the Fig.\ref{fig:without} it can be seen that the thermistors output is non-linear, and the curve shape is similar to the expected response. However, a static offset can be observed, which will be discussed the Error Discussion~\ref{sec:error}.

The T-R characteristic is shown:
\subsubsection{Linear}
Using the eqation~\ref{eq:linear} $R_{p}$ was calculated for linear range 45--90$^{\circ}C$. $B$ value is give in $^{\circ}K$ in the datasheet, but temperature range and measurements are in $^{\circ}C$, therefore it must be converted to Celsius:
$B_C=B_K+273.15=3977-273.15=3703.85$
$$T_{ctr}=\frac{90-45}{2}+45=72.5^{\circ}C$$
$$R_p=1807\cdot\frac{3703.85-72.5}{3703.85+2\cdot72.5}=1.705k\Omega$$
The R-T expected output with combined data from all linear measurement runs is shown in the following figure:
